# MongoDB Udemy course
- Excel in NoSQL & Pass Certification

## ROADMAP so far:
- Installing mongoDB using docker image [Tutorial how to](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-community-with-docker/#std-label-docker-mongodb-community-install)
- local database created, with no auth, some issues here

## MongoDB benefits
- MongoDB offers several benefits that make it a popular choice for many applications:

1. **Flexible Schema:** MongoDB is a NoSQL database that uses a flexible document-based data model (BSON). It allows you to store data in a format similar to JSON, and each document in a collection can have a different structure. This flexibility is particularly useful for applications with evolving or dynamic data requirements.

2. **Scalability:** MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally, making it suitable for handling large volumes of data and high traffic loads. It supports sharding, which allows you to distribute data across multiple servers or clusters to ensure high availability and performance.

3. **High Performance:** MongoDB is known for its high read and write performance. It employs various optimization techniques like indexing, query optimization, and memory mapping to provide fast data access.

4. **Rich Query Language:** MongoDB provides a powerful query language that supports a wide range of query operations, including complex aggregations and geospatial queries. It also supports full-text search.

5. **Geospatial Data:** MongoDB has built-in support for geospatial data and queries, making it an excellent choice for location-based applications.

6. **Automatic Failover:** MongoDB supports automatic failover using replica sets. In the event of a primary node failure, one of the secondary nodes is automatically elected as the new primary, ensuring high availability.

7. **Document Indexing:** MongoDB allows you to create various types of indexes, including compound indexes and geospatial indexes, to improve query performance.

8. **Community and Ecosystem:** MongoDB has a large and active community of users and contributors. It also offers official drivers and client libraries for various programming languages, making it easy to integrate with your application.

9. **Aggregation Framework:** MongoDB provides a robust aggregation framework for performing complex data transformations and computations, allowing you to process and analyze data within the database.

10. **Schema Evolution:** MongoDB's flexible schema and versioning support make it easy to evolve your data model over time without requiring extensive migrations.

11. **Security Features:** MongoDB offers various security features, including authentication, role-based access control, encryption at rest and in transit, and auditing, to protect your data.

12. **Cloud Integration:** MongoDB Atlas, the official cloud-hosted MongoDB service, simplifies database management, scaling, and monitoring in a cloud environment. It integrates seamlessly with popular cloud providers.

While MongoDB has many advantages, it's essential to evaluate your specific use case and requirements to determine whether it's the right choice for your application.
